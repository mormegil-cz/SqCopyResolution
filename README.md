# SqCopyResolution
A command line tool for bulk changes in SonarQube projects.

In this version, generalized to allow also multiple bulk SonarQube operations:
- `copyresolution`: The original functionality of this tool:  Copies Wonâ€™t Fix and False-Positive resolution flags between SonarQube projects/branches.
- `autoassign`: Automatically assigns all unassigned issues to the author of the respective code.

## How to use this tool
### Requirements
- Windows with .NET Framework 4.6.1
- SonarQube 6.x (the tool is tested with SonarQube 6.3 but it should work with older versions as well)

### Run the tool
Download the **SqCopyResolution_1_0_0.zip** file from the [**Releases**](https://github.com/HonzaTau/SqCopyResolution/releases) tab and extract its content into some folder. Then run the tool from Windows command line with following arguments:

|Parameter|Description|
|---|---|
|`command`|Which operation to run, currently either `copyresolution` or `autoassign`.|
|`-url`|SonarQube Url address, e.g. `-url http://sonarqube-staging.ourcompany.com`|
|`-username`|SonarQube credentials - username|
|`-password`|SonarQube credentials - password|
|`-sourceProjectKey`|Key of the SonarQube project, from which you want to copy resolution flags, e.g. `-sourceProjectKey OurProject:FeatureA`|
|`-logLevel` (optional)|Log level (All, Debug, Info, Warn, Error), e.g. `-logLevel Debug`. The default log level is Info.|
|`-dryRun` (optional)|Dry run only, do not do any modifications, just log what would be done, e.g. `-dryRun` (no parameters).|
||Parameters for `copyresolution`|
|`-destinationProjectKeys`|Comma separated list of keys of the SonarQube projects, to which you want to copy resolution flags, e.g. `-destinationProjectKeys OurProject:HEAD,OurProject:FeatureB`|
|`-sourceBranch` (optional)|Name of the branch from which you want to copy resolution flags, e.g. `-sourceBranch develop`. Specify only if you are using SonarQube branches.|
|`-destinationBranch` (optional)|Name of the branch to which you want to copy resolution flags, e.g. `-destinationBranch master`. Specify only if you are using SonarQube branches.|
|`-addNote` (optional)|Request that a comment should be added to the destination issue, mentioning the resolution has been copied from elsewhere, e.g. `-addNote` (no parameters).|
||Parameters for `autoassign`|

Here is an example of the command, which copies resolution flags from the `OurProject:FeatureA` to `OurProject:HEAD` and `OurProject:FeatureB` SonarQube projects:
```
SqCopyResolution copyresolution -url http://sonarqube-staging.ourcompany.com -username HonzaTau -password SecretPwd -sourceProjectKey OurProject:FeatureA -destinationProjectKeys OurProject:HEAD,OurProject:FeatureB
```

## Copy resolution notes
When you use multiple branches, you must create a separate SonarQube project for each branch. The thing is, that when you resolve an issue as **Won't Fix** or **False Positive** in one SonarQube project, the issue still remain open in SonarQube projects for other branches, even after you merge your code changes to other branches. This tool can copy **Won't Fix** and **False Positive** resolution flags from one SonarQube project to another.

## Auto-assign notes
You need to configure `SQ_UserMap` in the configuration file to list a mapping from commit e-mails to SonarQube logins. The format is `email@example.com=USRNAME;otheremail@example.com=OTHERUSR`.
